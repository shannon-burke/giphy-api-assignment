# Giphy API

Users type search terms to generate buttons with categories for gif population. Users then click on the buttons to hit the Giphy API and generate 10 relevant gifs on the page. Gifs may be paused/played by clicking.

## Opportunities for improvement:
- better styling
-- center content correctly
-- beyond basic bootstrap components
-- more explanation?
-- bottom buffer
- clear generated gifs are a certain number (50, perhaps?)
